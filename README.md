# MultiprocessProject
This is my project to pass system and concurrent programming, which involves synchronizing distribution centers with warehouses and couriers, 
with each distribution warehouse issuing orders that the warehouses try to obtain. 
The warehouse that manages to get the order sends it to the courier (each warehouse has 3 couriers). Each unit is a separate process.
